## Introduction - Intro

Hello and welcome to R.O.I.D...
R.o.i.d in certain massivley multiplayer online games (MMO's) also stands for Asteroid, but when abbreviated means 'return on investment developer' and this app is inspired by the space gaming community.
...A mining foreman or engineer, would board a specialised spacecraft and warp out into hostile regions of space to harvest a payload of important raw matierials. 
They would risk their conciousness with a very real possibility of being blown up inside their vessel via person verses person combat scenario (PvP). 
Losing everything = losing collateral & the time spent ammassing a fortune, could disappear very easily. 
What if I could build an app that helps return a players investment in time and money by purposely planning a routine based around my play style.
This could be done by building a sandbox item that can be plugged into any MMORGG sandbox. 
So r.o.i.d essentially is a task management tool that helps gamers organise their gaming style of play. 
The player will take full control by managing their activities with ease in any gamming environment.
R.o.i.D..

## User Experience (UX) - Intro
 
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

### Strategy
To design a functional styled website that acts as a basis of information but the site guides the user through a series of navigational links throughout the site
in a logical manner, whilst stopping at various points to open various content features. The purpose of which Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Vivamus felis leo, egestas sit amet libero vel, porttitor varius ex. 
This would keep the possibility of users coming back to use the site because of interest and intrigue.

### Scope
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Vivamus felis leo, egestas sit amet libero vel, porttitor varius ex.

### Skeleton

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   I have used the following global palette of colors for this project: --evergreen: #38855d; --text-gray: #112d60; --text-light: #686666da; --bg-color: #0e3746; --white: #fffaf2; --midnight: #104f55; --sky: linear-gradient(120deg, #a1c4fd 0%, #c2e9fb 100%);
    -   #### Typography
            I have used light font themes to add a friendly non formal appearence: "Carter_One", "Josefin", "Livvic", "Roboto".
        -   The Livvic font=family for nav links across the site & Carter_One commonly used across the site, with Josefin secondary font, which is light non invasive, 
            
    -   #### Imagery
        -   The imagery for this site is very minimal and reflects transparency and not flashy. The images of the urpis. Morbi molestie rutrum tincidunt. Ut nulla dolor, suscipit at augue eget, sodales posuere dui. convert well on all screen sizes

## Testing - Intro

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

## Testing - Write up

## when using Gitpod 

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

I have tested my project using Chromes developer tools, and Light House
The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.

## Updates Since The Instructional Video

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here is the version history:

**October 21 2020:** Versions of the HTMLHint, Prettier, Bootstrap4 CDN and Auto Close extensions updated. The Python extension needs to stay the same version for now.

**October 08 2020:** Additional large Gitpod files (`core.mongo*` and `core.python*`) are now hidden in the Explorer, and have been added to the `.gitignore` by default.

**September 22 2020:** Gitpod occasionally creates large `core.Microsoft` files. These are now hidden in the Explorer. A `.gitignore` file has been created to make sure these files will not be committed, along with other common files.

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

## Further Testing#
#Check site UX for navigational completeness - make sure links work - log links in readMe that are in development. 
#Check site UI - Ensure ease of use (does the site make sense).
#Check rating with lighthouse (screenshot results and use in readMe)
#Check responsiveness on all devices
#Check responsiveness on all web browsers
#Clear bugs - reference, the Slack community, tutors & online support, i.e console log.
#Run the code through (W3C) validators

#Testing Errors - Struggling to get past these...type of error sample below:

    **resolved by changing the order of content in the main.js file - **resolved**
    **resolved uncaught not defined type error in console for modal by moving JS to index.html file under modal because te complier was not reading the request from the js file **resolved**
